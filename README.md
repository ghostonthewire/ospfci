# OSPF Complete Implementation

Repository contains materials for _"OSPF Complete Implementation"_ book by John T. Moy.

* `cdrom` – allegedly, original source code of the complete implementation from attached CD-ROM. Hardcopy that I own doesn't contain CD-ROM, and code has been found on the internet. Copy of files from original CD-ROM is greatly appreciated.
* `ospf.org` – mirror of ftp://ftp.ospf.org/ospf.org
